## 🌟 Welcome to the Most Frustratingly Fun Game Ever!

Ever wanted to guide a determined little bird through an endless maze of pipes? Well, now you can! This is a modern React remake of the classic Flappy Bird, guaranteed to make you say "just one more try" at least 50 times! 

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Press SPACE or click to make your bird flap
2. Don't hit the pipes (they're not very bird-friendly)
3. Don't hit the ground (gravity is not your friend)
4. Don't hit the ceiling (we don't do space exploration here)
5. Survive as long as you can!
6. Rage quit
7. Come back for more!

## 🚀 Play Now!
